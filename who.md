Who we are and our mission
==========

We are Matteo Barbuti and Riccardo Crippa, two Italian graduate 
students with a great interest in history and focus on culture
diffusion. Riccardo is also an antique book expert and he had the 
opportunity to work for some of the most important dealers and auction 
houses in the sector, where he discovered the quality of old printing 
and the emotions that antique books can inspire. The idea of 
reproducing the Columbus Letter came after observing the reactions 
that people had reading and admiring the pages of an antique text. Even 
if they are extremely fascinated and attracted by the beauty and 
meaningfulness of the text they still feel a significant gap between 
them, caused by the idea that Bibliophilism is a hobby for a small elite. 
Even if public libraries try to attract people and make them discover 
their antique and precious treasures, that gap is always hard to 
overcome. For this reason, we started thinking about the best possible 
way to spread the knowledge and fascination on antique texts to a 
broader public. We finally decided to make antique books physically 
reachable by everyone, reprinting them with the same techniques and 
materials as those employed centuries ago by typographers. We strive to 
make it as accurate as possible and to keep the prices low in order 
to give to everybody the chance to purchase it.

To whom is the project addressed?
=================================
Our project has the aim to appeal to everyone interested in 
discovering his heritage through a direct interaction with a document 
that has made History. Moreover, we appeal to people interested in the 
history of publishing and in well curated editorial products. The 
edition of the Columbus Letter is certainly a nice way to properly 
celebrate the Columbus day and discover a milestone in American history 
which is too often forgotten. We also see it as a nice way to present 
historical documents to the young generation and make them reflects 
about the past through a direct contact with an historical testimony.
