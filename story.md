The Columbus Letter: a great treasure for antiquity lovers
====================

Tasteful anecdotes are related to the diffusion and conservation 
history of the copies of the Columbus Letter. During the XIX century, 
when bibliophilism was the hobby of the elite, the first edition was a 
great and hunted treasure. Due to the great price results that the 
edition was totalizing at auctions and the relative ease of creating 
copies of it, a great number of forgers tried to sell reprinted 
editions as originals. A forged copy was also proposed to the National 
Library. The forger asked for a price insanely high, a sum that the 
library could not afford to pay at that time. When the cunning 
antiquarian’s proposal was rejected,  he tore the copy apart in front 
of the librarians. Later in the day they collected the fragments from 
the trash ben and they discovered that the letter was just another 
well-conceived copy.

More recently, in May 2016, it was discovered that the copy of the 
Columbus letter conserved at the Congress Library had previously been 
stolen from a Florence public library and substituted with a copy. The 
thieves could have had possibly stolen the exemplar back into the 50’ 
and nobody discovered the fact until some scholars noticed some 
printing errors while they were conducting a research on the book. The 
attention that forgers and thieves have regarded even in recent times 
to the letter is related to its extreme commercial rarity and high 
economic value. last time the copy appeared in auction, at Christie’s 
in 1992, totalized 330,000$.

The story behind the first chapter of American History
---

The Columbus letter is the narration, written by Columbus himself and 
addressed to the king of Spain, of its first voyage to the new world 
and of its discoveries. The letter was written on February 15th 1493 by 
the admiral while he was on his way back to Spain aboard the Caravel 
Nina. It is addressed to the king of Spain and to Louis the Santander, 
the financial minister that decided to fund the expedition of the 
Italian explorer. It is the first written witness by newcomers about 
America and this Latin edition was instrumental in spreading the news 
throughout Europe about Columbus's voyage. It was printed in Rome by 
Stephen Plannck in May 1493 and more than 3000 copies were produced, 
making it one of the bestsellers of its time.

The letter was also used as a political instrument by the Spanish 
government in order to claim possession of the lands recently 
discovered. There were in fact some controversies with the Portugal 
kingdom upon the respective expansions areas previously stated in the 
Treaty of Alcacovas in 1479. The letter probably helped the Spanish 
kingdom to impose their vision thanks to the great influence that it 
exerted on the public and on pope Alexander VI. It was the Pope in 
fact that helped to prepare the famous Treaty of Tortesillas, signed 
in 1494 that partitioned the globe between Spanish and Portuguese 
spheres of exclusivity at a longitude line 370 leagues west of Cape 
Verde.

It is difficult to imagine the emotions and the excitement that 
Columbus’ narration of his voyage and discoveries generated in the 
souls of Europeans. In the letter, Columbus wrote about the nine island 
he encountered on its way and described with accuracy the population 
and the natural characteristics of the new lands. The tone of the 
letter is enthusiastic. It is difficult for us to imagine the emotions 
that Colombo felt when he was writing to the king of Spain reporting 
that he had just discovered the coveted way to India. Of course was not 
India but now we know how much more important Columbus discovery was. 
In the letter the entrepreneurial attitude of Columbus is genuinely 
visible. In his mind he did not discover a simple geographical entity, 
but a territory in which people could have had easily settled and 
started working to build a new and better world, the famous Eden on 
earth. It is interesting to notice in Columbus expressions the hopeful 
tone that would had been present, centuries later, in the “American 
Dream” image that led millions of Europeans to leave their homes for 
the new world in order to finally build the great country of hopes and 
dreams that already Colombo dreamt about in 1492.
