Support our project on kickstarter
==================================

Learn more about the story of the Letter and the details of our edition 
from our Kickstarter page and contribute to bring the first chapter of 
American history to the public domain. Given the cultural and 
historical implication of this text and his meaning for the American 
community we truly want to make everybody part of the reincarnation of 
the very first chapter of American history, this is why we chose to 
crowdfund it and spread it with the help of everybody. When we talk 
about culture we basically talk about knowledge that is created and 
transmitted collectively by a society through the interaction of people 
and ideas. It has seemed to us extremely meaningful to rely for the 
publication of the first chapter of American culture directly on the 
Americans in order to make them feeling actively involved in the 
project.
